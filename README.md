## Hi colleague!

#### Here are the following scripts available to run:

`npm run start:dev` - developer mode. Logging and hot rebooting are available in this mode, feel free to use it for your tests and experiments.

`npm run start:prod` - production mode. The application will be built and launched after building in this mode.

`npm run test` - Runs several tests to make sure nothing is broken.

If you are interested, `tsc` and `ts-node` are used for TypeScript transpilation, `nodemon` is used for hot reloading, `dotenv` is used for working with environment variables, `jest` and `ts-jest` are used for testing, finally `eslint` and `prettier` with their plugins  are used for codestyling in this project.
